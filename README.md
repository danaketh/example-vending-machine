# Vending Machine
A interview task for a software engineer position. Implement a vending machine in PHP which:
- accepts coins of 1,5,10,25,50 Cents and 1 Dollar.
- allows user to select product.
- returns selected product and remaining change (if any) in as little coins possible.

I've added some extra features:
- press reset to return all coins in the machine.

## Implementation notes
The vending machine is implemented as an interactive CLI command. Coins are represented as integers, where 100 is 1 dollar.
